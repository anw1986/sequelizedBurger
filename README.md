# Burger

* Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

* Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page. Aditionally, the user can click on the `Return to Menu` button, the burger will move to the original list on the left side.

* The app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not. It's **persistance**
